## Introduction

This repository is exclusive to the **learning paths** <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/training/">***Microsoft Learn***</a> in C# and **.NET** .

## goal

It is with great pleasure that I follow these routes, in order to acquire the necessary knowledge to develop applications with **C#** and **.NET**.
At the moment what catches my attention the most is the development of desktop applications. From user interaction with the graphical interface to the methods used in C# to solve problems. I think this is incredible.
